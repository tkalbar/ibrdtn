{\bf Use Cases.} There are myriad uses for the {\em GeoTracking} and
{\em GeoRouting} bundle extensions, as well as for the {\sc
  breadcrumb} router itself. We briefly describe three examples that
separate the motivations for tracking, geo-routing, and the
combination of the two.

{\it Safe Data Sharing.} Tracking bundles is clearly widely useful for
debugging and general spatiotemporal provenance. As a concrete
example, a secure application may want to track the movement of
bundles through space to ensure that bundles (and their content) never
leave a pre-specified ``safe'' zone~\cite{michel12:spatiotemporal}. By
placing a {\em GeoTracking} extension on each bundle, the application
can compare the trajectory of the bundle against the safe zone to
ensure the desired property.

{\it An Oil Spill.} Consider an environmental disaster, e.g., an oil
spill, detected by one or more distributed sensors. Based on the
location of the spill and simultaneously sensed ambient information
(e.g., water currents, winds, etc.), the sensor can compute where the
spill is likely to dissipate and generate bundles that can be
explicitly routed along the trajectories of dissipation. As the
bundles propagate, their routing paths (i.e., trajectories) can be
updated by devices they pass through based on locally sensed ambient
conditions (e.g., changes in water currents or winds). Our {\em
  GeoRouting} extension to the Bundle protocol's block format,
combined with our {\sc breadcrumb} router, can achieve this behavior.

{\it A Maze.} To bring tracking and routing together, consider a
prisoner is held in a maze, and the maze is patrolled by guards who
can act as intermediate DTN nodes. The prisoner sends a bundle with a
destination of a known rescuer outside of the maze. This bundle tracks
its trajectory, logging a successful path out of the maze. The rescuer
can send a response back to the prisoner, routed along the waypoints
of the turns in the maze. The response may contain information about
the perils of the exit path, sensed as the prisoner's original message
traversed to the rescuer. Using our {\sc breadcrumb} router, the
rescuer's return bundle can reach the prisoner regardless of whether
the particular guards in the maze change, as long as there exists
enough coverage of the maze path by {\em some} DTN nodes.
